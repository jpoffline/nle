\caption{Explanation of the link between geometrical objects in  the particle 3-form and material-metric formulations of elasticity theory. In the ``particle 3-form'' formulation, the only peice of information about the geometrical structure of the material manifold that is actually used is $n$, the dual of the particle 3-form. In the ``material metric'' formulation, one posits a metric on the material manifold which has more pieces of information which are used: its determinant, $n$, and quantites $\eta_{AB}$ which keep track of the shear-like parts of $k_{AB}$. The point is that the material metric construction keeps track of more information about the material manifold than the particle 3-form construction. In this way the former is more general than the latter.}\label{fig:obj_links}
