\@doendnote{endnote64}{\protect \textbf  {Pullback} Consider a map $F$ between two manifolds $M,W$; the map is $F:M \rightarrow W$. The manifold $M$ has coordinates $m$ and $W$ has coordinates $w$. Thus, $F(m) = w$. Now let us have a real valued function $f$ on $W$, written as $f: W \rightarrow \protect \mathbb  {R}$. We define the pullback of $f$ (which is on $W$) to $M$, written as $F^*f$, to be the composition $f\circ F : M \rightarrow \protect \mathbb  {R}$. So, let us pick a point $m$ in $M$, and act the pullback on $m$. This is written as $F^*f(m) = (f\circ F)(m) = f(F(m))$.}
